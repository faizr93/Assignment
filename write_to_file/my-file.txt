I'm New to Node Entirely
Doesn't matter
Learning is pretty fun, I often Learn and practice out side of work.
Sometimes search onspot.

Progress is I have Learned Lot of JS, Some of Async JS, I know how to use Node but not "node specific features yet'
they will improve with time

Next I will tackle Express, and Atleast Get You going, The learning can continue on side, Maybe in FallBack, 
Add Node,Express an hour for both.
